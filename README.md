This is a little ruby soft who aim to download random Unsplash pictures (you can change the query to get whatever you want https://unsplash.com/documentation)
All You need after this is to go into "System Preferencies", "Desktop & Screen Saver", then add the image folder, set the interval on whatever you want and it's over :)


Pair this with a little Cron task, Exemple :
